              Feeling safe and secure in our homes, communities and
              urban areas is a basic human right. Feeling and being
              safe is a key to overall health in the community. Safety
              and perceptions of safety feature highly in peoples, view
              of the living environment, their sense of well being and
              quality of life. As urban areas grow, the need for safe
              social and physical environments, where people are able
              to participate fully in their communities, becomes an
              increasing challenge.
