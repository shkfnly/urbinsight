The EcoCompass is the instructive companion to urbinsight. It represents both an educational training program with a distinctly participatory pedagogical approach, as well as a resource platform that is customizable and dynamically evolving. </h3> </div> </h1></h1></div> <div class="panel-group" id="accordion"> <div class="panel panel-default"> <div class="panel-heading" id="one"> <h4 class="panel-title" id="panel-title-color"> <a data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordion" href="#collapseOne"> i. Framework </a> </h4> </div> <div id="collapseOne" class="panel-collapse collapse"> <div class="panel-body"> The EcoCompass uses a framework known as participatory action research (PAR), which challenges structural barriers to information and provides opportunities for communities to directly lead the research process, thereby leading to community-generated solutions in urban planning and public policy. PAR is collaborative at every stage of the project and intends to result in some action, rather than research for its own sake.<br><br> PAR processes differ in the extent and frequency to which they involve diverse stakeholders, but typically consist of four stages. These stages are that of planning, acting, observing and reflecting, prior to planning again. This cycle can repeat itself multiple times over the course of a project to refine the methods used and their implementation.<br><br> In the case of the EWMP, this iterative approach is necessary as the data is being collected by, for and with the community; it is imperative that the questions asked, the techniques used, and the interventions proposed are defined and led by the participants.<br><br> The concepts and practices used as part of the EcoCompass can be defined according to three canons of knowledge: urban metabolism information systems (UMIS), geographic information systems (GIS), and public participation techniques (PPT). UMIS describes a system, along with all of its components, to account for and analyze resource flows as they move from the natural environment (i.e. a source) through the built environment (i.e. a city) back to the natural environment (i.e. a sink).<br><br> A GIS is a virtual method, such as a computer system, capable of assembling, storing, manipulating, analyzing and displaying geographically referenced information. It also includes the personnel operating the system and the data that goes into the system.<br><br> PPT applied to land use planning provide opportunities to spatially engage citizens through the use of GIS and UMIS; techniques covered include media campaigns, guided tours, facilitated meetings and groups, visioning exercises, visual preference surveys, design charettes and computer simulations.<br><br> Given its PAR processes, EcoCompass materials are developed in such a way so as to maximize participation, ensuring that community-based resources are offered in the appropriate language or dialect, framed using accessible terminology and concepts, and delivered in a meaningful way.<br><br> </div> </div> </div> <div class="panel panel-default"> <div class="panel-heading" id="two"> <h4 class="panel-title" id="panel-title-color"> <a data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordion" href="#collapseTwo"> ii. Scope of Engagement </a> </h4> </div> <div id="collapseTwo" class="panel-collapse collapse"> <div class="panel-body"> The EcoCompass is comprised of different types of engagement undertaken in a chronological format. The ten steps involved in the EcoCompass span two phases:<br><br> PHASE I : Knowledge Sharing<br><br> Step 1 - Introduction and Alignment<br><br> Step 2 - Partner Identification<br><br> Step 3 - Academic Courses<br><br> Step 4 - Leadership Roundtable<br><br> Step 5 - Bootcamp Training<br><br> Step 6 - Debrief and Adaptation<br><br> PHASE II : Implementation<br><br> Step 7 - Tool Refinement<br><br> Step 8 - Community Intensives<br><br> Step 9 - Neighborhood Planning<br><br> Step 10 - Project Development<br><br> The last step of the EcoCompass involves educational support for project development, and includes strategies such as establishing a database of best practices and construction standards for sustainable and equitable interventions; such a database is further populated by interventions implemented as an outcome of the urbinsight implementation.<br><br> The six steps that comprise the first Phase, that of 'Knowledge Sharing', have already been piloted in two cities as part of the urbinsight activities. The following sections summarize this Phase's activities.<br><br> </div> </div> </div> <div class="panel panel-default"> <div class="panel-heading" id="three"> <h4 class="panel-title" id="panel-title-color"> <a data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordion" href="#collapseThree"> 1. Introduction and Alignment </a> </h4> </div> <div id="collapseThree" class="panel-collapse collapse"> <div class="panel-body"> At the initial stages of identifying a pilot city and prospective international organizational partner (e.g. an academic institution, non-profit organization, neighborhood group), the Ecocity Builders team introduces the EWMP along with the core concepts of the EcoCompass.<br><br> Points of alignment are determined with existing programs and projects of the organizational partner.

Partner Identification </a> </h4> </div> <div id="collapseFour" class="panel-collapse collapse"> <div class="panel-body"> Initial meetings may include facilitated mapping of community assets and networks to determine further partners in the city to support the EcoCompass activities.<br><br> Such partners may include community-based organizations in the potential study areas, social and environmental non-profit groups, academic researchers, media developers and urban data repositories.<br><br> </div> </div> </div><div class="panel panel-default"> <div class="panel-heading" id="five"> <h4 class="panel-title" id="panel-title-color"> <a data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordion" href="#collapseFive"> 3. Academic Courses </a> </h4> </div> <div id="collapseFive" class="panel-collapse collapse"> <div class="panel-body"> A main objective of the courses is to prepare students for leading knowledge transfer activities when working with the community-based organizations, to build citizen capacity in the research, analysis and planning as part of the Bootcamp Training and beyond.<br><br> There are two proposed scenarios for academic institutions, such as colleges and universities, participating in the EWMP. They can either weave EWMP activities into an existing course’s curriculum, or adopt and customized the EcoCompass Course developed for the EWMP. In either case, the course curriculum may be more survey-based or more focused on data analysis.<br><br> In the first scenario, relevant resources are integrated into the course syllabus while select seminars and labs, that complement course objectives, are offered in accordance with the Project’s needs. This may be more compatible for engaging classrooms at the undergraduate level, senior high school, or in technical programs at colleges.<br><br> In the second scenario, the school adapts and institutes the EcoCompass Course; a curriculum specifically crafted for the intended purposes of the EWMP. This may be particularly suited for the ongoing research activities at the graduate level. In this scenario, the course uses seminars and labs to methodically cover five distinct areas relevant to the EcoCitizen World Map Project. These areas are: EcoCities and Sustainability Indicators, Systems Approaches, Participatory Mapping, Neighbourhood Audits, and Citizen Engagement.<br><br> The courses are also a critical step in collecting background and base map information about the city and study area that will serve as a foundation for the UMIS and GIS established as part of the EcoCitizen World Map for the pilot city. For example, as part of the classroom activities, students are expected to collect figures on UMIS resource flows, set up the relevant GIS geodatabase, and determine what existing PPT have been applied to the study area.<br><br> </div> </div> </div><div class="panel panel-default"> <div class="panel-heading" id="six"> <h4 class="panel-title" id="panel-title-color"> <a data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordion" href="#collapseSix"> 4. Leadership Roundtable </a> </h4> </div> <div id="collapseSix" class="panel-collapse collapse"> <div class="panel-body"> The Leadership Roundtable is an event coordinated by the course students inviting community elders, youth and leadership from the selected study area to a presentation on the EcoCitizen World Map Project.<br><br> The event includes a discussion that refines the purpose, scope and participatory process (including decision-making models, and data-reporting standards and questions around ownership of research outcomes) for Phase I.<br><br> It also serves to ensure that such leaders can identify how they would like to be engaged in the future project activities, particularly the Bootcamp which represents the next step in the scope of engagement. It is an opportunity to propose realistic targets and relevant forms of participation for the data collection, input and analytical processes. Examples of specific participatory activities may include training on GPS devices, co-facilitation methods, computer data entry, digitizing and geocoding techniques.<br><br> Finally, the Leadership Roundtable includes an initial discussion on neighbourhood boundaries, with the recognition that perceptions of these can differ depending on different resource flows and may become more refined during the Bootcamp activities.<br><br> </div> </div> </div><div class="panel panel-default"> <div class="panel-heading" id="seven"> <h4 class="panel-title" id="panel-title-color"> <a data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordion" href="#collapseSeven"> 5.
